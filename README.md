<Hello!>
This is an array of multiple images and a little bit of styling. The pictures I took from my own garden after those summer rains in 2021. I love finding "nature surprises" (as we called them in my household) and it was a great pleasure to be able to use them for this project. It might seem simple, but 3 weeks ago I didn't even know what an h1 was! 
</Thank you for stopping by.>
